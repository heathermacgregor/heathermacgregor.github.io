				 			Urate oxidase (uricase, UOx, EC 1.7.3.3) catalyzes the O2 degradadation of UA into 5-hydroxyisourate, the first step in
a pathway leading to allantoin, an easily-excretable substance 5-10× more soluble than UA.1 Although UOx is an endogenous
enzyme found in most mammals, it is inactivated in humans. However, recombinant UOx species, such as Rasburicase, have
shown to be promising candidates for the treatment of diseases including hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome. However,
uricase tends to form aggregates in solution that are highly immunogenic. Previously, XL-1-Blue Supercompetent E. coli were
transformed with plasmids containing the sequences for C319* and C319*-C253R mutants of Bacillus subtilis UOx. These
mutants were designed in order to prevent this phenomenon of aggregation. Here, the wild-type enzyme is purified from the cell
lysate of BL21 Competent E. coli cells. The purified WT enzyme will be used as a baseline for kinetic and light-scattering studies
of the recombinant mutants.

				 			Ferrocene is an organometallic compound first reported in 1951 and was the first
                known example of a class of compounds known as sandwich compounds, in reference to the iron(II)
                cation ”sandwiched” between two aromatic cyclopentadienyl anions. This structure is experimentally
                 supported by the 1H-NMR spectrum of ferrocene. The spectrum displays a single
                peak at 4.17 ppm with an integration value of 10; because all the hydrogen atoms present in the
                two cyclopentadienyl anions are equivalent, all 10 π orbitals on the ring structures must participate
                equally in coordination to Fe(II). Ferrocene exhibits chemistry similar to benzene and other aromatic
                systems, and has been used in polymer synthesis, small medical devices, and as an ”anti-knock” additive
                 in gasoline.

             <h3> Benchmarking Density Functional Methods for Prediction of Gas-Phase Vibrational Circular Dichroism Spectra </h3>
             <em> Research & Creative Activities Conference, UC Santa Barbara College of Creative Studies - November 02, 2019 </em>

            <h4> Abstract </h4>
			 <p id="abstract">
				 Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) is a type of infrared spectroscopy that is useful for the characterization of chiral molecules. Chiral, or "handed," molecules are particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry. Interpretation of experimental spectra is greatly aided by quantum mechanical calculations that can predict the spectrum for a given chiral structure. Thus, experimental VCD work is commonly accompanied by computational modeling.

						 <p id="abstract">
						  	The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry has recently acquired a new infrared spectrometer. This project aims to support the various experimental projects this instrument will take part in by streamlining the process by which calculated spectra are obtained.  Specifically, we will determine methodologies for efficient and accurate calculation of VCD spectra of chiral compounds and create a software workflow that will allow non-experts to submit their molecules of interest to a computational server and retrieve the calculated spectrum.

            <h3> Feeding State Dependency of Inhibitory Synaptic Dynamics in the Ventromedial Hypothalamus </h3>
            <em> Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students - November 15, 2019 </em>

            <h4> Abstract </h4>
			<p id="abstract">
              				Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key regulator of energy balance. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) has many BDNF-expressing neurons, and food deprivation selectively and drastically reduces BDNF expression. Although the complex neural pathways through which BDNF exerts its anorexigenic effects have not been defined, evidence suggests that it modulates synaptic plasticity partially by altering the excitatory and inhibitory synapse components of specific neuron populations.

			 <table>
				 <tr id="download">
					 <td width="35%">
						 <p id="abstract">
              				Our lab previously investigated the dependency of excitatory synapse occurence on feeding state and found that excitatory synapse occurence in the VMH is greater in the fed state.* Here, we evaluate whether a feeding state-dependency follows for inhibitory synaptic transmission.
