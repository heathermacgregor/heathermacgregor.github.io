### Benchmarking Density Functional Methods for Prediction of Gas-Phase Vibrational Circular Dichroism Spectra
_Research & Creative Activities Conference, UC Santa Barbara College of Creative Studies - November 02, 2019_

**Abstract** 

Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) is a type of infrared spectroscopy that is useful for the characterization of chiral molecules. Chiral, or “handed,” molecules are particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry. Interpretation of experimental spectra is greatly aided by quantum mechanical calculations that can predict the spectrum for a given chiral structure. Thus, experimental VCD work is commonly accompanied by computational modeling. 

The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry has recently acquired a new infrared spectrometer. This project aims to support the various experimental projects this instrument will take part in by streamlining the process by which calculated spectra are obtained.  Specifically, we will determine methodologies for efficient and accurate calculation of VCD spectra of chiral compounds and create a software workflow that will allow non-experts to submit their molecules of interest to a computational server and retrieve the calculated spectrum.

### Feeding State Dependency of Inhibitory Synaptic Dynamics in the Ventromedial Hypothalamus
_Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students - November 15, 2019_

**Abstract**

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key regulator of energy balance. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) has many BDNF-expressing neurons, and food deprivation selectively and drastically reduces BDNF expression. Although the complex neural pathways through which BDNF exerts its anorexigenic effects have not been defined, evidence suggests that it modulates synaptic plasticity partially by altering the excitatory and inhibitory synapse components of specific neuron populations.

Our lab previously investigated the dependency of excitatory synapse occurence on feeding state and found that excitatory synapse occurence in the VMH is greater in the fed state.* Here, we evaluate whether a feeding state-dependency follows for inhibitory synaptic transmission.
